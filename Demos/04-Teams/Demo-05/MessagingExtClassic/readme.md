> Note: To avoid having the ngrok name changed all the time use from within a Teams project in two seperate terminals, or even better run gulp start-ngrok in a seperate standalone console window.

Replace `gulp ngrok-serve` with:

```
gulp start-ngrok (from within a Teams proj)
```

```
gulp serve --debug
```
